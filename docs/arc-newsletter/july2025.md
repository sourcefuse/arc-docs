### ARC SaaS

1. **New Capabilities to SL CLI**: A new command has been 'sl mcp' has been introduced to our Sourceloop CLI. It starts and Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, so an MCP client can internally communicate with CLI commands. It is useful for integrating CLI capabilities into tools or automated workflows. CLI now scaffolds projects with **Trivy setup** for vulnerability scans replacing the previously used synk.

2. **Dynamic controller and Model Class Booting**: ARC Core introduces a new way to dynamically bind controllers and models, solving a long-standing pain point of static controller bindings. It automatically picks up updated model definitions avoiding code duplication, improving maintainability.

### ARC IaC

1. **MSK Module**: A new reusable terraform module that streamlines Amazon MSK cluster provisioning, making data streaming architectures faster and easier to deploy. It abstracts the complexity of networking, encryption, authentication, logging, and monitoring into configurable variables with safe defaults.

2. **Observability Stack – Now with Tracing Support**: The ARC Observability Stack module now includes SigNoz Community Edition, bringing together logs, metrics, and traces in one unified view.

   **Key Features**

   - Deploy OpenSearch, Fluent Bit, Prometheus, Grafana, and now SigNoz—all through one
   - Terraform module.
   - Native OpenTelemetry-based tracing support.

### ARC API

1. **Model Schema Override Support**: Tenant Management Service now fully supports dynamic schema overrides for data validation in controllers, powered by the new ARC Core booters.

   **Key Benefits**

   - Dynamic Schema Validation – Always respects latest model definitions.
   - No Code Duplication – No need to manually override controllers.
   - Consistent Behaviour – Centralized management of models & controllers.

### ARC UI

1. **SPA security**: [arc-spa-csp](https://github.com/sourcefuse/arc-spa-csp) a zero-runtime, Typescript powered CLI tool for Content Security Policy injection in React and Angular applications.

   **Why Devs Love It**

   - Smart Auto-Detection- Injects CSP into index.html automatically.
   - Env-Aware- Picks up REACT_APP_API_URL, VITE_API_URL, NG_API_URL.
   - Dev-Ready- --dev mode for quick testing.
   - Production-Safe- Nonce-based, strict CSP policies post-build.
   - Framework Support- CRA, Vite, Angular CLI, Workspace Projects.

2. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: A new breadcrumb navigation system for Angular that supports both dynamic and static breadcrumbs, with full Nebular icon integration.

   **Key Features**:

   - Dynamic Breadcrumbs: Auto-generated from Angular route configs with:

   1. Static labels via data.breadcrumb
   2. Icons via data.icon (e.g., home-outline, person-outline)
   3. Conditional visibility via data.skipLink

   - Async Breadcrumbs: Resolve labels on-demand via asyncBreadcrumb - great for dynamic entities like user/product titles.
   - Nebular Icon Support: Optional icons displayed alongside labels for better UI clarity.
