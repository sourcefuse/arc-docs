### ARC IaC

1. **Observability Stack with Tracing**: ARC Observability Stack now includes SigNoz Community Edition, bringing together logs, metrics, and traces in one unified view.

   **Key Features**

   - Deploy OpenSearch, Fluent Bit, Prometheus, Grafana, and now SigNoz—all through one Terraform module.
   - Native OpenTelemetry-based tracing support.
   - Simplified monitoring and debugging for Kubernetes workloads.

2. **EKS Updtes**: The ARC EKS Terraform module now integrates seamlessly with ARC EKS Auto, enabling auto-scaling of clusters based on demand.
   **What’s New**

   - Automated provisioning of EKS components.
   - Built-in best practices for security and performance.
   - Enhanced scalability with ARC-native auto-scaling logic.

### ARC UI

1. **Farm Integration in React Boilerplate**: We’ve replaced **Vite** with **Farm** in our [react-boilerplate-ts-ui]() to accelerate builds and improve development workflows.

   **What’s New**

   - Farm-based build system with farm.config.ts.
   - Continued test support using vitest.config.ts.
   - Updated image handling via URL-based SVG imports.

   **Performance Impact**

   - Significantly reduced build times.
   - Faster feedback loops in CI/CD pipelines.

### ARC API

1. **Enhanced ARC CLI**: To improve usability and align with user preferences across different teams and workflows, the CLI has been enhanced to recognize both sl and arc command prefixes. This dual-entry support offers greater flexibility, allowing users to invoke CLI commands using either name without any change in functionality.

- ‘sl scaffold’ and ‘arc scaffold’ work identically.

### ARC SaaS

1. **Sequelize Support**: We’re excited to introduce Sequelize ORM support in ARC SaaS services! Previously, our services exclusively relied on LoopBack's default Juggler ORM, which—while powerful—had limitations in terms of extensibility and ecosystem compatibility.

   **What’s Changed**
   **Before**: ARC SaaS services were tightly coupled with LoopBack’s Juggler ORM, limiting flexibility in database abstraction and migration workflows.

   **Now**: You can choose Sequelize as an alternative ORM—unlocking access to a rich ecosystem, improved support for complex associations, advanced query customization, and better developer tooling.
