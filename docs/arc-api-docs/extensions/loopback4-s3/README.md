## Overview

A simple loopback-next extension for AWS S3 integration in loopback applications.

## Install

```sh
npm install loopback4-s3
```

## Usage

In order to use this component into your LoopBack application, please follow below steps.

- Add component to application and provide access keys and other s3 initialization configuration details via AWSS3Bindings.Config binding as mentioned below. You can add any of the options mentioned [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Config.html#constructor-property).

```ts
this.bind(AWSS3Bindings.Config).to({
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION,
} as AwsS3Config);
this.component(AwsS3Component);
```

- After this, you can just inject the S3 provider across application.

```ts
import {S3WithSigner} from 'loopback4-s3';

@inject(AWSS3Bindings.AwsS3Provider) s3: S3WithSigner,
```

## Migration to a version after 4.0.0

`loopback4-s3@4.0.0` is the last version that would be using aws-sdk v2, after that all the versions are going to be based on [`aws-sdk v3`](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3).

You should remove any previous installation of `aws-sdk` from your projects if you have it installed just for `loopback4-s3`.

The client from v3 sdk no longer require the `.promise()` method to return a promise -

```
const data =  await v2client.command(params).promise() // in v2

const data = await v3client.command(params) // v3
```

The client provided by the `loopback4-s3` package extends `S3` class and not `S3Client`, so you do not need to create commands to use this module.

You can read [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/migrating-to-v3.html) guide to know more about migrating your code to `aws-sdk-js-v3`.

The `getPresignedUrl` method is also missing in `aws-sdk/client-s3` client, so it is provided in the extended client returned by the provider. The documentation for this new `getPresignedUrl` are provided [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/modules/_aws_sdk_s3_request_presigner.html)

You might also have to install `cmake 3.1+` on your machine if [`aws-crt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-crt) is not available as a prebuild package for your system.
